My take on the #20 Games Challenge

The goal of the 20 games challenge is to gradually learn more about game development through a series of small projects. At the end of the challenge, you should be comfortable creating games in your engine of choice without a tutorial. 

This challenge was proposed and made by SDG Games. You can view more about it on https://20_games_challenge.gitlab.io/

Pong was the first widely successful arcade game. It was released in 1972, and started the first arcade boom. The game may seem simple today, but it was designed directly in hardware. Essentially, Pong was a specialized computer designed to bounce a ball between two paddles and keep score.
Pong 24, while being similar as Pong introduces a small twist. Instead of resetting ball's position after a point has been scored, the ball continues it's trajectory and the game ends only after a player scores 24 points before the other.
